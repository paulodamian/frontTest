# FrontTest

I have used basic styles for the application due I am not a designer, but I could implement any given design on any application/page.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### How to run it with the service worker
```
A simple solution is to intall npm serve (https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)
npm install serve
Then create the build (npm run build)
npm serve dist/
```
